# User Behavior on Google Merchandise Store (Tableau)
This dashboard provides us a glance of user behavior on Google Merchandise store and the data was from the Google Analytics data collected on August 1, 2016. 

In the first graph on the top, we can see that most of the revenue were generated from the Northern America users. Most of them spent less than 50 USD dollars on the website, but there are still 17 users who spent between 100 – 150 USD dollar. Since the users tend to buy cheaper products on the website, Google should try to increase the users’ average spending in order to increase the total revenue. For example, the store can offer packaged several office products together for bundle selling in a cheaper price than buying separately. 

After knowing our main customers were located in Northern America, we then curious about what is their shopping behavior, so we generate two graphs showing the users’ most-used device and channels as well as their active time on the Google Merchandise store. 

From the left graph, we can infer that Northern America users mainly used desktop to browse the Google Merchandise store and came from referrals. Based on the information above, we recommend Google to build the brand awareness of the Google Merchandise store first since compared to users from referrals, only a few of users noticed the Google Merchandise store and actively searched it online. To build the brand awareness, Google could either launch display ads or collaborate with KOLs to introduce the Google Merchandise store and let people know more about it. Moreover, through the graph, we also found that the mobile users were around 50 % less than the desktop users. In this mobile-first age, it is not a good phenomenon. It is better for google to make the website more mobile-friendly and focus on increasing the mobile users. 

From the right graph, most of the visits from America are in the evening. It shows that most users have more free time to shop online during the evening which is also a good timing to reach the potential users. Thus, when launching the online ads about the Google Merchandise store, Google should allocate more ads spending during the evening or create a new post on social media during the evening.
